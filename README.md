# Bootstrap_Nucampsite
This is the Nucampsite app created using the Bootstrap Framework.
We learned these technologies in the 2nd month of Nucamp's Bootcamp.

To view the site online instead of locally you can visit:
https://wcbootstrapnucampsite.netlify.app/

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The site opens to the "Home" page where a carousel is cycling through
    different campsites with a coding theme.
In the Jumbotron you can open a Reserve Campsite Modal with a
    bootstrap themed form lets you search for a Reservation.
The Navbar has various ways of navigating along with a Login Modal.
There is no backend so this information goes no where.
Below is a zig zag pattern page layout.
The footer navigates you to various sites within and outside the site.

Next in the "About" page we see a breadcrumb trail has been added
    below the navbar.
The page then begins with a Card and a quote and below that an
    Accordion of different partners.
Fianlly a table created with a Bootstrap theme.

Lastly we have the "Contact Us" page that opens with ways to reach
    out to Nucamp. Numbers and emails are all fake.
At the bottom is a Feedback form that goes no where.
